"""Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer 
from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) 
time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

Bonus Challenge: Is it possible to find the max and min in a single 
traversal?
