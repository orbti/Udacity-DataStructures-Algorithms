# Udacity-DataStructures-Algorithms
This repo will contain all the projects I submitted for Udacity's Data Structures and Algoritms course.
## P0
Project Overview 
In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

What will I learn?
In this project, you will:

Apply your Python knowledge to breakdown problems into their inputs and outputs.
Perform an efficiency analysis of your solution.
Warm up your Python skills for the course.
Why this Project?
You'll apply the skills you've learned so far in a more realistic scenario. The five tasks are structured to give you experience with a variety of programming problems. You will receive code review of your work; this personal feedback will help you to improve your solutions.
